# Algorithm Name: 
Merge Sort

## Demo video/gif/screenshot of test: 
https://streamable.com/ik2a0t

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking: 
Decomposition:
- Take a list
- Divide list in half, get halves of list
- Split those halves
- Repeat till at 1
- Sort the nodes
- Repeat until list is sorted

Pattern Recognition:
- It repeatedly splits lists in half until they are 1 item long

Abstraction:
- the user just puts in a random lsit of numbers and gets out a sorted list. They dont have to sort anything
 
Algorithm Design:
-  Input: finite list of numbers
-  Processing: put the list of numbers into the merge sort algorithm
-  Output: Sorted list of numbers

## Steps To Run:
1. Enter 1-10 integers.
2. Press the run button.
3. Watch the algorithm sort your list of numbers from least to greatest.
